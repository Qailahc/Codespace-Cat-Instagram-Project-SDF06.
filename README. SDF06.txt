Reflections
Areas of Mastery

CSS Layout Techniques: I am skilled in utilizing Flexbox and Grid for organizing web page elements. Applying these methods to position and arrange content was a standout aspect of my learning.

Responsive Design: I effectively used media queries to ensure the page appears well on desktop and mobile screens.

Styling Elements: I succeeded in creating a profile picture, user details, and gallery area that all have a strong Instagram-like aesthetic.

Challenges Faced

Responsive Design for Smaller Screens: It was difficult to change text sizes and layouts on smaller screens. In order to maintain consistency and functionality in the design, I had to test out various strategies.

Hover and Focus Effects: It took more trial and error and research to get interactive components like hover and focus effects working properly. I stuck with which semmed best.

Areas for Improvement

Advanced CSS Properties: My goal is to improve user experience by investigating more complex CSS attributes and animations. In order to improve the user experience, I want to investigate more sophisticated CSS attributes and animations.

Code Optimization: Even though my code produced the desired result, I think it could be more effective and easier to comprehend.

Creative Design Choices: For practice, I stuck quite similar to the Instagram layout, but for future projects, I'd like to try out some more imaginative design options.
